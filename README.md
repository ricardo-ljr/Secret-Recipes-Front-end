# Front-end

Website: https://secret-family-recipes.firebaseapp.com/

## Technology Used:

This application was created using React for UI, and Redux for state management.

## Goal for this application:

Our team wanted to create a single-page application using React in which users were able to store and share recipes amongst their families. 

We accomplished this goal by creating a simple authentication process, leveraging the endpoints create by our Backend developer to retrieve recipes, add new recipes, update your own recipe or delete recipes. 

For future iterations, we would like to be able to add a comment section in which users can leave their feedback to family members.
